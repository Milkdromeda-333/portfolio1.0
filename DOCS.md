Challenges:

- I was having issues remembering how to format layouts with css grid, so I referred to a resource that I hav referred to alot, and used a code playground, codepen, and made a test to figurure out how to make the layout and what I was doing wrong. In the end I was able to trouble-shoot and simplify my styling.
