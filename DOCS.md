Challenges:

- I was having issues remembering how to format layouts with css grid, so I referred to a resource that I hav referred to alot, and used a code playground, codepen, and made a test to figurure out how to make the layout and what I was doing wrong. In the end I was able to trouble-shoot and simplify my styling.


Notes:

- Found this code snippet for making a gradient over text.

```
h1 {
  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(#eee, #333);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
}

```
