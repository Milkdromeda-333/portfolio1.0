          <p className='text-2xl'> I am a web developer with experience with front end and back end development. I have a passion for colors, organization, self-love, reading books, rain, learning, being curious, thinking about the unknown, and coding. When I''m not coding I am practicing sign language, eating food, watching horror movies, or thinking about coding. I am currently living in Las Vegas, but I am a Dallas, Texas native.</p>
